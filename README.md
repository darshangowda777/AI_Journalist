    The AI Journalist system is designed as a modular, end-to-end pipeline for automated news and text corpus analysis, summarization, and verification. It begins with a Classical NLP stage that performs tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), TF-IDF keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis to extract linguistic and contextual features from the corpus. The **Retriever (Hybrid)** module then combines sparse lexical search using BM25 with dense semantic search powered by Chroma embeddings, producing a balanced retrieval of documents that are both lexically and semantically relevant to a given query. Next, the **Summarizer/QA Agent**, built on an instruction-tuned sequence-to-sequence model such as Flan-T5, generates concise factual claims supported by structured citations that link back to the retrieved documents. These claims are passed to the **Verifier**, which evaluates their factual accuracy by measuring semantic similarity between claims and evidence, detecting contradictions through Natural Language Inference (NLI), and assessing temporal consistency. The **Orchestrator** manages the full workflow, automatically re-running the retrieve→summarize→verify sequence with varying retriever weights until a sufficient confidence level is achieved. In our implementation, the initial composite confidence score was **0.500**, which was below the defined threshold of **0.700**. After running the model twice and adjusting key retriever and verifier parameters, the system successfully improved the overall confidence score to exceed **0.700**, indicating a high level of factual reliability and model consistency. Finally, the **Visualization and Explainability** component provides both static plots and an interactive Gradio dashboard, enabling users to explore retrieval performance, document-level explanations, and overall pipeline confidence in an interpretable and visually engaging manner.
